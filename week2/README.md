# CS50 Python Week 2 - Conditionals

Welcome to Week 2 of CS50 Python! This folder contains problem sets and lab exercises from the second week of Harvard's CS50P course.

## Folder Contents:

### `bank`
- A program that prompts the user for a greeting.
  - If the greeting starts with ‚Äúhello‚Äù, output $0.
  - If the greeting starts with an ‚Äúh‚Äù (but not ‚Äúhello‚Äù), output $20.
  - Otherwise, output $100.
  - Introduction to conditional statements and string manipulation in Python.

### `deep`
- A program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.
  - Outputting Yes if the user inputs 42 or (case-insensitively) forty-two or forty two.
  - Otherwise, output No.
  - Practice with conditional statements and handling user input in Python.

### `extensions`
- A program that prompts the user for the name of a file.
  - Outputs the file‚Äôs media type if the file‚Äôs name ends with certain suffixes.
  - Supported suffixes: .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .pdf, .txt, .zip
  - Introduction to string manipulation and conditional checks in Python.

### `interpreter`
- A program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression.
  - Calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place.
  - Assumes user input in the format x y z (x is an integer, y is an operator, z is an integer).
  - Introduction to basic arithmetic operations and string parsing in Python.

### `meal`
- A program that prompts the user for a time.
  - Outputs whether it‚Äôs breakfast time, lunchtime, or dinner time.
  - If it‚Äôs not time for a meal, don‚Äôt output anything at all.
  - Practice with conditional statements and time-based logic in Python.
